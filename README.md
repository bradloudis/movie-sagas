# Movie Database Project

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

Creating a movie management application using the full stack. There are 3 separate views: Home Page, Movie Details Page, and Add Movie Page. The Home Page shows all of the movies from the database. The Movie Details Page shows details for a specific movie, including the title, description, genres, and movie poster. The Add Movie Page includes a form to add a new movie to the database.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

The Home Page displays all of the movies in the movie database. Click a movie poster to navigate to the Movie Details Page for that movie. Click the **BACK** button to return to the Home Page. Click the **ADD MOVIE** button to navigate to the Add Movie Page. Complete the form and click the **ADD MOVIE** button to save a new movie to the database. (note: all fields are required!) Click the **CANCEL** button to return to the Home Page.
